This application uses a Mongo database, so be sure to start mongod.
In order to initially populate the database, run the following command at the project root: yarn seed.
This should insert a few records into the MongoDB.
Run yarn start at the project root to start the application.

Open your browser to localhost:3000 and take a moment to study the rendered application.
